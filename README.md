# Mobile Apps Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed data from the Apple iOS Store to uncover valuable insights that can guide app development and marketing strategies. The project involves data cleaning and a short Exploratory Data Analysis.  While this project is relatively straighforward, the purpose was to get familiar with SQL queries.

## Files
- `queries.sql`: The main file containing various SQL queries for the analysis.
- `data/applestore.csv`: The dataset containing information about more than 7,000 Apple iOS apps.
- `data/applestore_description.csv`: The dataset containing the app descriptions.

## Features
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Developing Strategic Recommendations for App Development
